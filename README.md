# CYD-ESP32-2432S028R<br><br>
<hr>
Here is where I'll post my projects for the CYD 'Cheap Yellow Display' ESP32-2432S028R.<br>
For more information about CYD, It's setup, and examples please look at Brian Lough's Git repository https://github.com/witnessmenow/ESP32-Cheap-Yellow-Display?tab=readme-ov-file<br><br>
The 'R' at the end of ESP32-2432S028R stands for 'Resistive', which is the type of the touch screen attached to the module. Most of the time you'll only find ESP32-2432S028 printed on the back of the boards. It took me awhile to figure this out, so I figured I would post it here to help anyone else.
