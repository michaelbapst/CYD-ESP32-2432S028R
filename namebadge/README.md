This is my first CYD Project. <br>
I haven't coded in c/c++ since the mid 90's, so the code is extremely rough.<br>
Name badge pseudo randomly chooses 1 of 95 Names of Odin (who has over 170 aliases), displays it in the Roman Alphabet and the Elder Futhark alphabet for 2 seconds, and then randomly chooses another.
