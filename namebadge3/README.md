Namebadge3 does exactly what Namebadge & NameBadge2 does.
Like Namebadge2, We replaced the Switch/Case statement with a 2D String array.
The diffence is, When the screen is touched, the random number is now seeded with X * Y of the screen touch point.
This allows psuedo random picking of names to be a bit more ramdom. This way the list isn't always the same everytime you run the app.
Also cleaned up a lot of comments, and gave better attributions.
